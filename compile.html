<p> Please compile, please compile,
    It would surely make me smile,
    When I glance at the clock,
    And thirty minutes has gone by non-stop,
    I think that I've won, that I've beaten the odds,
    But alas it is not the day, says the evil programming gods,
    As this is all a ruse, just one big long deception,
    Since my terminal froze ten minutes ago, from an UndefinedException</p>
